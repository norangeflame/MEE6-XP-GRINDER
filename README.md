# MEE6-XP-GRINDER
### This MEE6 XP Grinder for Discord allows you to work or game while grinding message XP in the background. I'm not really sure if anyone would actually use this but here it is :)

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

XP-G by norangeflame

TO TOGGLE ON/OFF
Ctrl + Windows Key + Z
If the countdown is on and it says "Active", then the grinder is on.
It is off by default when opening the app, so you'll need to press the keybind to start it


### Main Features:
 - Sends a message every 60 seconds (with MEE6 you can only get 15-25XP once a minute, to stop spammers)
 - Works while Discord is open in the background
 - Auto-deletes the message (glitchy, fixes soon)
 - Can get around 10k XP in 12 hours†

†(you can't really get much more than that since you can only get 15-25XP once a minute)




DISCORD MUST BE OPEN (THE WINDOW NEEDS TO BE SHOWING IN THE TASKBAR), HOWEVER THE DISCORD WINDOW DOES NOT NEED TO BE "FOCUSED" OR "ACTIVE".
AS LONG AS DISCORD IS RUNNING, THE XP GRINDER SHOULD WORK.

THE WAY MEE6 WORKS IS THAT IT ONLY GIVES YOU XP FOR MESSAGES THAT ARE 60 SECONDS APART, MEANING IF YOU SENT 10 MESSAGES WITHIN 60 SECONDS YOU WOULD ONLY GAIN XP FOR THE FIRST MESSAGE. THE GRINDER SENDS 10 RANDOM WORDS TO THE DISCORD WINDOW (SO IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE ACTIVE, JUST OPEN IN THE BACKGROUND).

THE XP GRINDER HAS A FEATURE (THAT YOU CAN'T TURN OFF AS OF RIGHT NOW) THAT AUTO-DELETES THE MOST RECENTLY SENT MESSAGE. THIS FEATURE IS SOMEWHAT PATCHY AND MAY NOT ALWAYS WORK, SO IT IS RECCOMMENDED THAT YOU USE THIS GRINDER IN YOUR OWN PRIVATE CHAT (NOT A PUBLIC DISCUSSION CHANNEL, FOR EXAMPLE). THIS FEATURE ALSO WILL NOT WORK IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DELETE MESSAGES.



THE GRINDER WILL GET AROUND 10K XP EVERY 12 HOURS, WHICH MAY NOT SEEM LIKE MUCH, BUT SINCE MEE6 ONLY ALLOWS YOU TO GAIN XP EVERY 60 SECONDS, THAT IS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN GET (SPAMMING WON'T WORK AND IT COULD ALSO GET YOU BANNED ETC.)

That's all. Enjoy your using the Grinder.

Also from testing the Grinder works best when Discord is NOT the active window - for some reason if it's active then the auto-delete doesn't work so fixes coming soon :)

### Coming soon:
 - Customisable keybind to toggle the Grinder
 - Fixes for Auto-delete, also an option to turn it off
 - Estimated XP counter
